# Simple Client-Side Spam Filter

A basic web application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to demonstrate client-side text classification and spam filtering using Regular Expressions.

This project was built to understand how simple text-based spam detection works without relying on external libraries or complex machine learning models.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Client-Side Filtering:** All spam detection logic runs directly in the user's browser (no server required).

- **Regular Expression (RegEx) Based:** Uses predefined RegEx patterns to identify common spam phrases and patterns.

- **Intuitive Interface:** A simple text input area and a button for immediate classification.

- **Instant Feedback:** Provides a clear message indicating if the input text is classified as "Spam" or "Not Spam."

## 💻 Installation and Setup
